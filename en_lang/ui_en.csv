"plot_content_1","Cut it out！ Don't yell！ I'm the only one who can hear you here. It's been a century， and you've arrived， at long last..."
"plot_content_2","Who are you？ How come I can’t see you？ Are you a human， or a ghost？"
"plot_content_3","Humph！ Of course I'm human！ Ah well， I'll let it pass. \\nI am the <TDName>「Heavenly Saint」</>. Just call me <TDName>「St. Heavens」</>. \\nAs for why you can hear me...I'm a grandmaster of <TDName>「Whispered Secret」</>. Such a feat is but a breeze to me."
"plot_content_4","<TDName>「St.」</>……<TDName>「Heavens」</>？ What is this place？ Where are you hiding？ ？"
"plot_content_5","I've strode these lands for centuries， and amassed no shortage of foes. Should word of our meeting spread too soon， I fear I might be forced to endure another hundred years. \\nKnow simply that this land is called <TDName>「Great Wilds」</>. The very place where you and I are trapped. You must hasten to master strength and ascend to <TDName>「Champion」</>. When that time comes， I shall reveal to you how to free me from my confinement."
"plot_content_6","Of course， I shall not let you go unprepared. All martial arts in the <TDName>「Great Wilds」</> stem from my teachings. You bear my sigil; as long as you acquire a kungfu technique， mastery will come with ease. \\nTake this <TDName>「Heavenly Scrolls」</>. Should you face challenges， I shall provide answers. May you rise swiftly to greatness. This serves both our interests."
"plot_content_7","The <TDName>「Heavenly Scrolls」</> contains the essence of my knowledge. Its wisdom will be unveiled with your Trials."
"plot_content_8","I suppose I have no other choice. But why is this <TDName>「Great Wilds」</> so tiny？"
"plot_content_9","Tiny？ \\n……\\nAlas， it appears too much time has passed. You have forgotten your own nature. Lad， remember this： You are a <TDName>「Cultivator」</>. Once you regain your strength， you will come to understand the many secrets of this world."
"plot_content_10","So what should I do now？"
"plot_content_11","...\\nIndeed， you have forgotten a great deal. Here， let me lend you a hand， as I still have some time. \\nThere is a <TDName>「Regional Trial」</> in every lot in the <TDName>「Great Wilds」</>. You can pass the Trial in this lot first."
"plot_content_101","Excellent！ Your skills and intellect well exceed my expectations. \\nKeep up the good work. There is hope for my liberation！ Hahahaha."
"plot_content_102","What should I do next？"
"plot_content_103","Open <TDName>「Pigeon Post」</>， and you'll see how to cultivate the <TDName>「Great Wilds」</>. There are unique resources in each region. \\nUse them to help you grow. Know that the world is a complicated place. Tread with care. \\nIf you have deep pockets， try seeking out <TDName>「Cargo Ships」</> to expand new lots."
"plot_content_104","Uh...I got it."
"plot_content_201","Hold on！ Don't go further into the sea！ It's dangerous！"
"plot_content_202","What’s out there in the sea？ ！"
"plot_content_203","Why？ Looks calm enough to me."
"plot_content_204","Go back， now's not the time！ When the time comes， I shall tell you everything."
"plot_content_205","I need to see for myself what is out there."
"plot_content_206","Ah well. A taste of hardship will do the lad some good."
"plot_content_301","As the world expands， more forces will emerge in the <TDName>「Great Wilds」</>. You won't be able to navigate its treacherous waters without considerable strength. Right now， it's important that you join a sect and build up your skills. From there， you can make your way to your <TDName>「Champion」</> mantle."
"plot_content_302","How can I join a sect？"
"plot_content_303","There's a <TDName>「Bulletin Board」</> at the Mountain Gate of every sect. You can take a look， see if you meet their Entry Requirements."
"plot_content_304","Got it."
"plot_content_401","Take heed！ <TDName>「Bandits」</> will appear in new lots. Eliminate these thugs， and you can build a Reputation. Remember to demolish their Shacks and Cages， lest other ruffians take shelter again."
"plot_content_402","What if I’m no match for them？"
"plot_content_403","Hire bodyguards， or set up traps. Sometimes it's prudent to avoid confrontation. Once you've become stronger and commanded your own forces， these bandits will be nothing more than small-time crooks."
"plot_content_404","Got it."
