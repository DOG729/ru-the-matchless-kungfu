"14fff0f9920a723d53774be59dffed7a","I took away everything {0}{1} has. Ah， the ecstasy！ Perhaps I don't need to worry about my past after all. It's best to live in the present！"
"863ccd76c33d9d8c0c82afea355b69b7","Break his limbs."

"32e60646621173e3b728a839548bed0b","That way"
"1c95403de8f5fe2ebfb35d0530204b96","You must be the hero the hunter spoke of. Alas， misfortune befell him after you left. He asked me to give you these items if you were ever to return， so that you didn't help him deal with those monkeys for nothing."
"d8b8113412ef4684b1a29bc34cab6845","Accept"
"93045fbe58a987b0e61ae80d7747cb7b","Since he has passed on， it's best that his belongings go with him."

"51b4d0ea4b9f4ad62b243703dfb7ebd7","You should watch your words and actions， young one. It's best to treat others with kindness， or you won't know when you might make enemies."

"30f5820ceb7e1a6defb251604e7c8d4d","I'll let it slide. Here's the village. Go find the Clinic and treat your wounds."
"691e8b0a2023cfd6b28912d571c88b44","That's the way I am！"
"a756d3659afa66bebf18758ede3da59c","Well， suit yourself."
"b8940c8ba5f258d5c65184f4b897c003","It won't serve you well to make needless enemies. Even my patience has its limits. Go treat your wounds at the Clinic. Don't be so reckless in the future！"
"9a3aa60039f359d804e9936a6fc9e01b","Thank goodness I was nearby to save you in time."
"5ac3370172c3fe1ec0f5482ef8ea12f6","I was attacked by bandits when I journeyed through the wilds. Fortunately， a master named {0}{1} intervened and saved me from harm. After talking to him， I learned that the former Champion had also suffered from memory loss. Perhaps I could uncover the truth about my origins if I became the Champion？ I should ask {0}{1} about sects when I have time."
"d48adcb46e1336fed8c6b347f48469b8","Are you alright？"
"124c92147cf9b4afb05714fd24e296fa","Thank you， good master. Allow me to repay this debt in the future. May I know who I am indebted to？"

"d397e0e3689df754a18f06bf0550d473","Ah， it appears you're unaware of your natural kungfu talent. A one in a million prodigy. I couldn't resist being drawn to your potential. That's why I came to save you. That begins the bond between us."
"93c8d0121f9bb99f66e28ff12f255f02","I wonder if you've heard of memory loss."
"89432e14b3b18a93aa98b1245a27ae77","Indeed I've heard a thing or two about this curious condition in my travels. It's rumored that the former Champion had also been afflicted， but no one knows how they were cured."
"da4b85743e76d677a9d73f3145c93405","Do you know anything about the Cargo Ship that bore me here？"
"cccc16a24ce75385e9a0c2b1a5c9fece","The mysterious Cargo Ship is connected to a secretive force in the kungfu world. It has far-reaching implications that even Champions would hesitate to speak of. Champions are also related to your memory loss. It seems that you have no other choice but to become the Champion， should you wish to know more."
"1ac90d2d1823e68df5ff6f5ccbf446f0","Guess I have to let it drop， for now."
"258e9dc0192854e3f1418ba9a922eb9b","Your Kungfu is impressive. I wonder where you hail from."
"3fa155082672633613255fb5aa903d97","Hahaha， I'm but a lone traveler in this world. There's nothing impressive about me."
"504d28ae4e364f149155a08143ac37ff","Thank you for helping me out. I wonder if you could teach me a few moves."
"2ea3b742695701f7db50b0b204596697","Hahaha， I'm used to a laid-back life. Teaching is not a thing for me. Very likely I'll point you in the wrong path."
"ce4f62c041a9370985403ee65eecc416","I really mean it. Please， could you honor my request？"
"d531c57f9f5c565c84b0d1c172802dbb","Hahaha， alright， alright. I was indeed intrigued by your natural talent. It would be insincere of me to pretend otherwise. I may be able to teach you a few moves， but my learning may not be suitable for you. I do not wish to distort such a fine gem as you. There are many prestigious sects in this world， each with its own profound arts. My knowledge is limited， but I can give you a simple overview of these sects. Feel free to ask me if you're interested. You can then choose a sect that appeals to you."
"10704081f024262e3ae00b62d10320ff","Thank you， good master."
"07cc740821824a06e01206e8d6b11c10","I was about to step into your battle with the bandits， when you treated me to an impressive showdown. Hahaha."
"fe24b7e81f1c41eb4f91dc20caceb282","I was attacked by bandits when I journeyed through the wilds， but I managed to defeat them. It was not until a master named {0}{1} started clapping that I realized there was someone there. After talking to him， I learned that the former Champion had also suffered from memory loss. Perhaps I could uncover the truth about my origins if I became the Champion？ I should ask {0}{1} about sects when I have time."

"a9a75271d806f972cdf53fd65205ac62","It's troublesome！！ I just want to speak with my fist！"
"7415e3158c6f8a91a67be6158a394ca9","Ignore them"

"230b29bbc20fd729783006c1393ea52d","I only dabbled in the basics. It's nothing to boast about."
"2f0fce5619a1734dfcf812f0dd6eab6d","Hahaha， your modesty is commendable. I knew you're meant for greater things. Now that we've met again， I'd like to aid you in your Kungfu training. Name something， and I'd oblige."
"287093301ea47fe605d71b3cc76d957e","Thank you. I'll give it some thought."

"0848f81ff6b5829f47ef255cd4d2029f","It's been a while since {0}{1} and I last met. After catching up， he offered to assist me in my kungfu pursuits. Upon my request， he gifted me a handy Weapon. I was overjoyed."

"f7581237019fb6ff2eefb41aac95aa48","Haha， is that so？ Well， let's leave it at that. I'm in a good mood. If you have a request， feel free to name it."

"b297f44897bf73a59b938fe70780778d","What's your name？ I don't think we've met before."
"df40c0d06fdc529419660d3a7a034d94","Does 「Yuwen」 ring a bell？ I'm his sworn brother. He often talked about you. Sadly， he passed away a while ago. He knew of your pursuit of kungfu. Before his passing， he entrusted me with finding you and offering you guidance."

"3fa5dfa70c943a24ca8fda730ea3c4d9","Seems they noticed after all. The timing isn't ideal， but when push comes to shove， we have to carry it through."
"2b9d984597441cff23df2688bdb0582b","Master？ How come you're here！ Did you see what just happened？"
"0b01023e8a48459d1cf535699d8cc63b","We're in the midst of a crisis， so there's no time for catching up. You've raised the alarm of the Venerables. The substitution spell no longer works. I can only appear before you in my true form."
"78b2f8eb667a67168ca02ff21d62f2c1","The substitution spell...it resembles the possession spell of those two Venerables！"
"32f52655340dcb1648ba520c6ac2c520","Hehe， didn't expect you to be so perceptive. I dared not reveal too much before you regained your memories， seeing there's so much at stake. But now， there's no point in keeping this from you any more. I shall tell you everything."
"e8c48e53fcd55701c002dc3f0adeb774","Who are you？"
"ef3db1b78b18f29cd12926632e309a2c","I am the Heavenly Saint. For centuries I've walked the Kungfu world， and honed my skills to perfection. Yet I was felled when defending the beings of these Wilds， stripped to my primordial spirit， having to possess bodies to exist."
"4cc121ccb71c8b110f4076a308aaa632","Who are the Venerables？"
"5c75d6f6d803f4cc36379194b7b6303a","Heh， the so-called Venerables are the most wicked beings to walk this earth. Centuries ago， they founded the Huanmos Temple and used vile means to collect the world's Kungfu Skills， destroying numerous sects in the process. All they wanted was to control the Great Wilds and place the whole world under their tyranny."
"bf297ddf4f846e557ab560386cd3bb0d","Who am I？"
"39ead1b91ab80aa9812813e30be36825","As for you， haha. Hundreds of years ago， there was one who strode the Wilds undefeated. One hailed as a Kungfu legend， the unchallenged champion of the martial arts world. Indignant at the deeds of the Huanmos Temple， the righteous hero set out with his friend to take down Huanmos."
"e4dc119f45886b41b93b62c490ae506b","Would that be... ！"
"e47e6c92d875765aff9468569e85b160","Yes. You are the Kungfu legend of yore， the uncrowned lord of the Wilds. And I...I am the Heavenly Saint， the friend who fought alongside you in Huanmos Temple."
"53744097592d37b882fda587551521e3","And what became of that battle？"
"80ea8c8e4c1a19a480d67ec23d75a4e2","We suffered a crushing defeat. Turns out there were a band of Primal Kungfu masters in Huanmos Temple， while on our side， we two were the only ones to reach that realm. Faced with such disparity， you were gravely wounded and fell into a coma， while my body was destroyed， leaving only my primordial spirit."
"30b9070a5195ed9ea569ccd69ead7008","What about the ship？ What's the ship about？"
"e5209f4a03926dd4a247ce6460e05d63","That's the Ferry. The Venerables use it to reap the world. Inhabitants of the Wilds offer their valuables. Kungfu experts are ferried to Huanmos Temple， where they are devoured and assimilated， to ensure the Venerable's rule."
"85510b7a08e306ca087efb9870a588d4","Are they aware of their fate？"
"2bbabcfd78a2f428bf9bd174ce14871b","Would that make any difference？ You saw what the Venerables are capable of. They have ascended the Primal realm， far beyond the reach of mortals. Their wield a truly terrible power. Whoever dares defy them will be erased from the world， the entire family exterminated."
"a0c81d8cbea217a43113558d32d3177f","Why do they call me Cultivator？"
"0de11805763c81bc0f4a9ecacf9c7738","Hahaha. You cultivate the world， just like a farmer. They brainwash those who defy Huanmos， until they become mere pawns. These pawns surveil the world for them， removing uncertainties and fortifying their rein."
"88bab03e70f2decc5c910468563e61fa","Why did I wake up on the ship？"
"ee413c5f14839aea25dc869d553dc155","After our defeat， I went into hiding， thinking I no longer had the power to defy Huanmos Temple. Little did I expect to see you again， here in the Wilds. Fortunately， you were born with Kungfu talent， and I needed very little effort to summon back your primordial spirit and soul. That's why you were able to learn all these Kungfu skills with ease. After all， you created many of them yourself."
"97b8f2e2664463c9be3887d0a1a78fac","It all makes sense now."
"e5dd9d803624d8636f324b7cb4dbe089","...What do you plan to do next？"
"62b2fae0a1d519ac15dcfcec1f2f5127","It's not about me. It's about both of us！  Should we uproot Huanmos Temple and restore this world to peace and order？ Or spend our days in hiding， watching as people suffer."
"3f4dee52bde35c39eb05618cb55b45a3","For the sake of the innocent people， we cannot evade our obligation."
"de3806dfa71316057a7cc8ca4b4e48e2","Haha， exactly the hero I remember！ Well said. In this world of ruin， who else can shoulder this obligation， if not us？"
"01fd84134a0b56d983a7ec1f34283705","Tell me what I need to do."
"d90475822f13657a9bac4551d9828065","You need to cross the ocean. Head north and seek the Huanmos Temple realms beyond the sea. They have sharks in the sea. You must be very careful. If you have good Energy， you can use the Qinggong Fly On Water and traverse the sea. If you have enough Vigor， you can try being swallowed by a shark， as it will bring you straight to Huanmos Temple."
"2afc51a4502a0bb23b964d516257a474","Are we going just like this？ From what you told me， I'm not what I used to be."
"ab30540f01eff7042bdab4b0c010e426","Of course not， if the Venerables were vigilant. But so used to power they are， they have long ceased to care about worldly affairs. Almost everything is handled by their Huanmos Servants， puppets of Huanmos Temple. They possess powers surpassing mortals， but so predictable they are， it will be possible to take them down with might or wit."
"7dbc3a06de0917309c826d69a80b35ba","Even I am no match for Huanmos Servants， who have surpassed mortals."
"4dbd2299271a146ded97e9055dabd2ce","They are but a bunch of lowly wits. As long as we are careful， we'd be able to divide and conquer. As long as we can open the Heavenly Gate before the Venerables have time to react， we can set free everything they have amassed over the years， with or without form. By then， it will be too late for the Venerables to do anything."
"e4cfa0015b4a500b76cda51c67421593","What's the Heavenly Gate？"
"ca25c17127a125890c78a760f03eeee3","The Huanmos Temple plundered not only rare treasures， but also the Energy of kungfu experts， the souls of martial arts prodigies， your memories， my body. All of these have been locked within a place called the Heavenly Gate."
"acd15796dc30b654fb6624ba8b53f2ae","I never knew a place like this existed."
"813881b9aa68e2229bbbec6ec3854a6e","If I had told you before today that someone could harness the weather and engulf the Wilds， you probably wouldn't have believed me."
"33d6e1ca55560b274f7eca6c63b54e70","That's amazing."
"305938135f92ca433053de3aa1224e2c","Very well， the decision is up to you. No matter what your choice is， know that I'll have your back. Farewell..."
"09ac030d1a0d8c331cc766ae89ec6fe2","Even if I don't stand up against them， I don't think they'll let it pass."
"366247b0f6d921cd198d9ec4df2b60f8","Such an ominous aura. Who are you again？"
"affee6573de78ea7d5530491b7318746","I'm [Yuwen]. You don't recognize me in this form？"
"2d15ef7eb88e5faeb78edb30f95ab114","[Yuwen]？ ！"

"36ce25861865193a6504ebf4d11a0ef2","Since I arrived， I've felt strangely disoriented. Is this really where my past lies， or is it all just an illusion？ Who am I， really？"

"4266021af6bedcc9c545082591d58a41","The Tavern Manager said that years ago， Yan Xiaosheng brought back a person， covered in blood， from the Dragonspring battlefield."
"d343d015ef3f2cb3201e684c87397448","Could that person have been... me？"
"88ca79bb925842f4fb1f90db1375b22e","A once-powerful emperor who ruled the martial world. An assassin's guild that dared to strike down the emperor. A person drenched in blood..."

"dba8826433d22c807558c7f3b6ba3e36","It's clear I carry something important—something worth saving. Otherwise， why would Yan Xiaosheng have saved me？ If we were close， wouldn't he have told me when I first woke up？ It feels more like there's something he wants from me... or perhaps something both the grand emperor and the Silent Raven want."
"1a2f92132f7a811842145fa72c5bdbbd","And those assassins—they could have been hired because of me. Still， I don't fully understand who I am. The grand emperor lived over a hundred years ago. The assassination was also long ago. Was I even involved back then？"

"6d5e5c2de6068d9717d4b76879a1d1b8","Some things are inevitable. Back then， your meridians were destroyed， and you were on the brink of death. I intended to bury you in the Six-Mile Longting."
"3647d6989d6a4c336d9d7f702f9db654","But， against all odds， you survived. And not only did you recover， but your meridians and bones healed completely. Three years ago， your injuries were fully healed， but you remained in a coma... until that day."
"0d012ea4f1ce4c0a73ac89b7ac49e60a","That day...？"
"17cddf5ceb0a2ef4dc92694c151c3d22","Yes， you woke up， but you lost all your memories. At the time， I thought losing them might be a blessing. It would keep you out of the turmoil of the martial world."
"4fda164e7db1e73d2f255f38192db9e1","Then why did you send me here？"
"396196ad15f0efc47847a0d7d5d404b5","As an old friend， I understood your heart. I didn't want you to get pulled back into the chaos， but I also didn't want you to live aimlessly. Coming to Dragonspring Town or not —it was your choice to make."
"2d8555a8cfa100c31de6eb466f6630a2","You gave me a goal when I was lost， and now you say it was all my choice？ So much for letting me choose."
"86d51ce7753a36079041fc15f7248035","Heh."
"54eb432d4f079cfe1b09adfaefb1265d","Believe what you will， but as soon as I entered Dragonspring Town， I knew something was wrong. It didn't take long for me to encounter these assassins from the Silent Raven."
"a2c629148ab8b14033bbb1c1085a6d6f","Why are they after you？"
"e673f09eaf6eff9e24bfaa7b40194599","I overheard them calling you a traitor."
"c5256c9d091e1d024d3aa0c10047ee7b","It's no secret. I was once a member of the Silent Raven. And I was your closest friend. In the end， I chose you over them. That's why they call me a traitor."
"7d07245171b8177fe273008b788e1ee9","At first， I wasn't sure why both the Grand Emperor and the Silent Raven were so desperate to find you. But when I saw how quickly you recovered from your injuries， I knew you were hiding a great secret."
"3cc92c36631d4b51eb827f6396a00089","You don't know what that secret is？"
"5e8633e141295c9b7a5058c19e30576a","You don't have to be so suspicious of me. If I really wanted to deceive you， I would've done it the moment you woke up. Why bother with this elaborate plan？"
"ab445835cdc1a76a4290d3ebb76b2e43","I'm still not sure why these two powerful forces are after you... but now you should find a safe place to hide."
"223b3aa9cca6b8a32854f5a0848325eb","Where can I hide？"
"773ab4a289dbafff1a035981f50348e9","The world is vast. If you find a remote place to disappear， you can avoid them."
"b412c407716eaa230d22e87675ba9ef7","Why should I hide？"
"48d9f084753ffe0ec77bb896afce2da3","I almost forgot—you've lost your memory of the Silent Raven. Once they target someone， they will stop at nothing until the job is done. Even if their employer dies， they will continue until they've fulfilled their contract."
"beeffb61f9eee3c8d9773bc239ec9b3e","How do you think you can avoid them？ There's no way to defend against their kind. I was once part of them， so I know their methods well. I fell into their trap today， and if it weren't for you stepping in， I'd be dead by now. How do you expect to escape their grasp？"
"54b40625b2f3f8120f39e8b4333f6d3f","So， no matter where I go， they'll eventually find me？ I can't live in fear forever."

"b28fba39e8742d19c926a1ee70e71863","Are you planning to take the fight to them？ Back then， your martial arts were extraordinary， almost unrivaled. Even so， you nearly died. With your current skills... you're no match for them."
"982fdf22a78e83a4cc2e90604f20c211","Yan Xiaosheng sees your determination， then pauses， speaking softly."
"5f60b5a7040933cc434ee138c03bd208","Is there really no way out？"
"c7a43e353afcd61b815067562f0d3e60","Not entirely hopeless."
"fc2b0728bd592c786bbb20f8e3462ac4","What do you have in mind？"
"ca2cdc21fbb602eaad3b2af059ecffef","The Silent Raven has informants all over the martial world， but they were still suppressed. If it hadn't been for the Grand Emperor's guard being spread thin， the Silent Raven wouldn't have succeeded."
"01256b736cfb9633687fac642778ed2a","Nowadays， the only force with that kind of influence is the new rule set by the major sects after the Northern Invasion."
"94e335fa79adc89532cc847ebef4dafc","New rule？"
"898e92f231995894d1d15c41bf690e10","Back then， the Grand Emperor's martial prowess was unmatched， and no one dared defy him. After he vanished， the central lands were thrown into chaos. The remaining sects， to avoid repeating such disaster， agreed to hold a grand competition every five years. The Champion becomes the martial world's new leader."
"feaa3ad5e1f25a3e705163bab5ae18ed","And you think this leader can stand up to the Silent Raven？"
"d6ce97471a8cc0147431d8e13ce03c90","Martial leader？"
"8f559be370d6be710214f71866eee365","The Champion， with all the sects behind them， commands considerable authority. While some sects might defy them in secret， the Silent Raven is a common enemy. Besides， after their battle with the Grand Emperor， they're not as powerful as they once were. Otherwise， they wouldn't be sending weaklings like those after me."
"ad5f98b0aaab25c71b6578401a2f167e","You could always hide somewhere."
"e3bdc14ca42bc3374e6bcae7754dcf92","Seems like that might be my only option."
"11c1040a1aeb4b1fa05c84c54994305a","The Champion is decided through the Kungfu Contest—a competition of skill， not a fight to the death."

"520c2063f432113b1f3cf2aaac2ed1d3","Where is the contest held？"
"5f845f720e8b6df9c680ff2ee7508e11","The contest has a specific location， but you'll only be informed if you're eligible to participate."

"bce45a8b691707bbdc88ba990392c891","It's held every five years， but the date hasn't been set yet. You still have time to hone your skills and prepare."
"c70e858d574dc7a2eb34a46fef4f9073","How do I enter the Kungfu Contest？"
"02ca9c9eeb65fd6c2c3cf2664d5d8728","It's an agreement among the major sects， so you must either join a sect or start your own to enter. Only elders or higher-ranked members can participate.\\nIf you want to start your own sect， keep in mind that it needs at least 30 members to qualify."
"b998a09d725186e0a53a3c93bda65fd3","Do I have to be an elder？"
"5312a0d0373be7ba014200f4f18b7fe0","Well， if the sect has fewer than 16 members， they may select top indoor disciples to participate， but that rarely happens. You don't want to rely on that. So it mostly comes down to experience."
"417a5f50f2c95e93dfb144c7fc3ca695","I see."
"f2cfce4d76dffbd20c09ef45fc393260","What are you thinking？"
"e8e2c377557b95d46bb002049a2d4d14","I still have questions for you."

"46a229ea376ca967610c9a449bc61e7b","You were heavily poisoned earlier—barely able to move. How did you suddenly recover and kill those two？"
"dee6bd6e315dc82b76026c29e728ca48","About the poison"
"53d0a2e934f7f16f64aa0333f7ad1f3b","Why didn't they drag me back for questioning， or wait until the poison fully took effect？ Attacking in broad daylight—weren't they afraid something would go wrong？"
"745d9198f83fac9bcdbc1b0fff7a55e6","It's partly the Silent Raven's nature， but also， I used to serve them. I'm highly familiar with their poisons. These drugs only work on me temporarily， and that's why they rushed their attack， knowing they didn't have much time."
"870a5aa87e2e3ed96f99ce219fbe7f46","I've decided to enter the Kungfu Contest."
"ef7f85af77ecea7d014bd367b39cf4cd","I won't stop you， but remember—the Silent Raven has influence everywhere. Their true strength is unknown. If you choose this path， it'll be riddled with danger. You might not even live long enough to qualify for the contest before they kill you."
"c5e830564d222513855765bee15c139b","Was I ever the type to be cowardly and afraid of trouble？"
"5686eab410e15251ff2a054fe16e49f2","You're still the same as ever. Very well， I won't stop you. I was going to recommend some sects for you to join， but given my situation， traveling together would only make things riskier for you."
"73685db393cc99a5cf62fb8ebce1619e","With the upcoming contest， many martial artists are gathering in here. Take a look around. You'll likely encounter quite a few. Whether or not you can gain entry to a sect and secure your spot in the contest， though—that's up to you."
"9d26f7758c8e76f971891ae559cb2fff","Can you introduce the major sects？"
"1c955bddaeadeae13f95ef026ce6829c","Ah， I almost forgot！ Though I can't help you join any of these sects， I can certainly tell you a bit about them as a reference."
"b1354d061204b794af572c5aa8dc7751","In the past， the martial world was ruled by six powerful sects， each with their own unique skills， standing as the undisputed leaders under the imperial court. However， after the northern invasion， these six sects were the first to bear the brunt of the attacks， suffering heavy losses. They each sealed their gates and disappeared without a trace."
"a18a993c8ed4846ecd7eb96f842fe6b6","Now， eight emerging sects have taken their place. Though new， these sects have deep connections to the old powers."

"91dac513b8df66e4764d40ea8962058b","Oro Sword Sect is situated atop Mount Beimang， surrounded by snow all year round. They specialize in frost-based energy， mastering both sword and palm techniques.\\nFounded by the third-place winner of the Heavenly Pool Sword Conference， their Arctic Palm and Snow-melting Sword skills are renowned.\\nAs for why they didn't win？ That year， two unmatched swordsmen were competing."
"522b90a710b62b7e7021543f1d4bf2ad","Fire God Vale"
"29d39be377013a6bb3284458fc176b24","Fire God Vale， located in Rubycliff Ravine， specializes in flame-based energy and excels in blade and palm techniques. The sect's founder， once a senior figure in the Skyforge Pavilion， left over ideological differences. Their Sky-Heating Saber style is unmatched， and they've since dominated the smithing trade. If you're into forging weapons， this is the place to go."
"b4fa5bfcd3696c04ff8fc42c30d76e85","Bamboo Pond"
"f6bab1d98e9a0ca8328e375dd8a22773","The sect shares its name with its home， Bamboo Pond. Though the founder wasn't creative with names， their concealed weapon techniques are extraordinary，\\ncapable of overwhelming foes. The previous sect master won the last Kungfu Contest but later vanished.\\nHis disciple Huan Changsheng is a rising talent—if you meet him， it could be worth forming a connection."
"e2e74bcc12b8a5816f3403e57d5610ab","Millibeast Sect"
"1981a9311afe6afe96b179ca98ac4c85","Millibeast Sect's founder could naturally speak with animals， creating a unique style from fist arts. They made a name for themselves in the first Kungfu Contest，\\nand their mastery of taming and training beasts remains unmatched."
"ce0e252ddb30d43e2370b66987c15ce6","Drunken Immortal's Parlor"
"90b60ee82f81c1af519b0ee1d7104aba","Drunken Immortal's Parlor started as a simple tavern but grew into a major force after mastering drunken-style martial arts.\\nIts members are carefree and skilled， and the sect is famous for its secret brews that produce some of the finest wines in the martial world. Their former head was a legendary figure， often mentioned alongside the top heroes of the north and south."
"dca1292bf51a23df5aa3fab4673b7e3e","Five-dragon Cult"
"3dcc6b9623fa10b8356c5c90f4a3155e","Five-dragon Cult came from the tribal region and is known for controlling toxin insects，\\nwhich can manipulate minds—a dangerous art.

"d1c61da4bbd1baa89a47dc66ed5f384d","I'd avoid dealing with these folks if possible. They seem nice， but they're obsessed with gods and spirits， claiming divine forces control the world. Ridiculous， right？ Still， their ability to manipulate fate with strange methods is unsettling.\\nI don't buy into their beliefs， but their fortune-telling skills are surprisingly accurate and might be worth a try."
"9498ed3c293a4f3aa895c50f977fffe8","Nethershade Cult"
"e7531645cedf821730575062f3ae0cf3","Nethershade Cult used to be called Medicine Valley， but they renamed it to sound tougher. Though they're healers at heart， they've gained a dark reputation.

"b55dbc2bf5141be189303a5ce8a89af9","You make a fair point."
"4937d9bd98832f4e34edcc4d9fb1d324","Hearing the monk's words， the creature bows to the villagers in apology， leaving them at a loss for words."
"90ef85f65d2fcd8bb085d49a4fb468ed","If you truly repent， and promise to stop troubling the villagers， call out three times as an oath."
"7df0c9633d2d11eaefbb2b0c4a448a82","I was wrong. I'm sorry. Forgive me."
"ac144089ce1b8626afbb61ef9f895053","The Master doesn't speak the beast's tongue， yet the furry creature seems to understand him. Fascinating."

"2209bb2a2eb1969329e5396b04c3b8ad","Seeing this curious scene， the three villagers are at a loss. It's true that the furry creature has stolen the herbs they rely on for a living. Yet their kind nature forbids them from harming a sentient being. Caught between their livelihood and conscience， the good-hearted folk are unsure what to do."
"14f5cae65e87a04ad541204e98168d84","(With that being said， the villagers have suffered real losses. Words alone， while convincing， won't make up for that. Is it really fair that they forgive and forget， denied even the right to be frustrated？)"

"3a8b6aed32452b36ef07489b386c5757","Buddha have mercy. I have some alms collected on my journey. Perhaps they can compensate for your losses."
"0b00f7383bbac18b13c881f1d511a6fa","Well... this fellow has stolen herbs worth 2000 coins. You only have 1000 coins here. That's not enough."
"82009c287f2d85b753992fb57e0f7888","You can see the turmoil on the villagers' faces. They want to be kind， but their own lives aren't easy. It's not a lack of compassion. It's the harsh reality of life."
"b8904e99b62d716b9abb57b800c58773","[Persuade] Speak up."
"12b682a848c0266cb5c062b1456f9d28","The world respects strength as much as reason. The master has kindly asked you to show compassion. How can you not listen？ If he were to use force， you'd learn the hard way how money could cost you your life."
"4ad749729521aed7ec725a64728ebbad","My friend， that's not—"
"af52d4d266e4b89ea8cb10c973fd388e","The monk starts to speak， but you silence him with a look. After a moment's reflection， the villagers nod reluctantly."
"a513d5c19a0ad82b2e0424106c32b2e3","Fine. Consider it an act of charity. But let me be clear. If this fellow causes any more trouble， no amount of pleading will help."
"103b87e80ee58606fa613f4359b8da55","Sow good deeds， and you will reap good fruit."

"a22fff3697565d6940b7e7f990e24492","The villagers count the money you offer， visibly relieved."
"013ca5f238ed4bcac479211dbc655185","It's enough. We don't want to make things difficult. Good to see things turned out well. We'll take our leave now."

"c29fbfe5fb7e9a53e367afec53adfe69","A simple child， unaware of worldly matters. He took the words of fellow disciples to heart and ran off with our sacred manual. I seek to bring him back."

"935ab0a9a65f99b8d50104308dbc28c9","No. I'm simply following fate. In the meantime， I get to travel the world and observe humanity. After years of isolation on the mountain， we have become less grounded. Out of touch with the world. Perhaps that's why my disciple went to such extremes."
"e7cf370cfa77ca5779649c74812c55a2","What does he look like？"
"2d2eda5a7c0fc6d515630d51a6685e4a","He is a stoic person who speaks with twisted reason. He has a volatile temper and is quick to violence. If you happen to see him， it's best to keep your distance. Just send word to me by messenger pigeon. And you， return to where you belong. Do not trouble the villagers again."
